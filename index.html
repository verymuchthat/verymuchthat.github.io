</head>
<body>
 My professional aspirations are ambitious. Longterm, I plan on creating software that has both domestic and military applications. Shortterm, I am going to secure a spot being a web developer for companies like shopify in ottawa. Prior to completing this 2 year course I will take addition college courses to expand knowlege of web development and computer programming. I am also extreamly intriguged by cyber-security
 there is a one year course avaliable at this school that requires college credits to take it. I can't wait! I trust myself. I am intelligent. I grasp core concepts easily. I am grateful to be in school. I am a life long learner. </body>
